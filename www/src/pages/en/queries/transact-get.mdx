In cases where your data is frequently changing, but you need to ensure that results retrieved from multiple `get` where not modified during retrieval, you can reach for `transaction.get()`.

## Performing Write Transactions

To perform `get` transactions with ElectroDB you will first need to create a [Service](/en/modeling/services). Available on the `Service` exist two methods `transaction.get()` and `transaction.write()`. These methods accept a callback function which is then provided with the entities of the service, and should return an array of queries. Creating a `get` query within a transaction is identical to performing `get` directly on an entity, only instead of terminating your query with a `.go()` or `.params()` you use `.commit()` instead.

```typescript
await yourService.transaction
    .get(({ entity1, entity2 }) => [
        entity1.get({ prop1: 'value1', prop2: 'value2' }).commit(),
        entity2.get({ prop1: 'value2', prop2: 'value3' }).commit(),
    ]).go();
```

### TransactionItem

For each operation provided in your transaction, you can expect the following interface to be returned, which is also exported for TypeScript users. ElectroDB will return an array of the same size as what was provided, with results for each operation in the same order as they were provided.

```typescript
type TransactionItem<T> = {
    failed: boolean;
    code?: TransactionItemCode; // 'None' | 'ConditionalCheckFailed' | 'ItemCollectionSizeLimitExceeded' | 'TransactionConflict' | 'ProvisionedThroughputExceeded' | 'ThrottlingError' | 'ValidationError';
    message?: string | undefined;
    item: null | T;
}
```

Property        | Type                   | Description
--------------- | :--------------------: | -----------
failed          | `boolean`              | If the transaction failed to write, this value will be `true`
code            | `TransactionItemCode`  | The `code` property is construct of DynamoDB, you can [read the docs here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_TransactWriteItems.html#API_TransactWriteItems_Errors) to learn more.
message         | `string`, `undefined`  | The `message` property is construct of DynamoDB, you can [read the docs here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_TransactWriteItems.html#API_TransactWriteItems_Errors) to learn more.
item            | `EntityItem`, `null`   | The item if one existed at the time of query


## Response Format
Unlike the DocumentClient, if your transaction fails to write, ElectroDB will resolve and signal failure through a top-level boolean `canceled`, and with additional detail for each operation provided in the transaction.

### Returned

Calling the async `.go()` method on a transaction returns the following interface. If your transaction failed, expect the `canceled` boolean to be true. The array `data` contains the results of each operation provided to the transaction in exactly the order it was provided.

```typescript
{
    data: TransactionItem[];
    canceled: boolean;
}
```

## Execution Options

Execution options can be provided to the `.params()` and `.go()` terminal functions to change query behavior or add customer parameters to a query.
